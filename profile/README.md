# Overview

Convened by the [Group on Earth Observations (GEO)](https://earthobservations.org/), the Global Ecosystems Atlas is a cross-sector collaborative initiative to map and monitor the world's ecosystems, providing dynamic visualisations of natural environments.

The Atlas will empower decision-makers with insights for sustainable development and a deeper understanding of Earth's ecological diversity. It will provide everything you need to know about the distribution, change, condition and risks of ecosystems worldwide.

The Atlas will combine existing high-quality ecosystem maps and new ecosystem maps to fill data gaps. By enabling collaboration across sectors and countries, the Atlas will generate knowledge and insights on ecosystems, help improve and scale existing initiatives, and enhance consistency and coherence in stock-taking, reporting, and decision-making.

# About the Atlas GitHub pages

On these pages you will find the repositories that manage all the phases of Atlas production, including: data cataloguing, cross referencing to the Global Ecosystem Typology, map synthesis and app production:

### 1. [Data cataloguing and cross-referencing](https://github.com/geo-global-ecosystem-atlas/geo-data-catalogue)
This repo contains code and other information used to manage the cataloguing pipeline. In here you'll find lists of all datasets assessed for inclusion in the Atlas, along with detailed information and metadata about all data sources actually included in the synthesised Atlas layers. This repository also contain cross reference tables which explain how source dataset map classes are assigned to the Ecosystem Functional Groups level of [IUCN's Global Ecosystem Typology](www.globalecosystems.org).

### 2. [Data processing and synthesis map production](https://github.com/geo-global-ecosystem-atlas/geo-extent-baseline)
This repo contains code and other information used to process all input data sources and synthesise into the final 119 layers of the Global Ecosystems Atlas.

### 3. [Platform and web app development](https://github.com/geo-global-ecosystem-atlas/global-ecosystem-atlas-platform)
This repo contains code and processes for the development of the interactive web app, designed and managed by key project partners, [Vizzuality](https://github.com/Vizzuality/).

### 4. [Maldives accelerator project](https://github.com/allenai/maldives_ecosystem_mapping)
As part of the [Global Ecosystems Atlas Maldives Accelerator project](https://earthobservations.org/solutions/incubators/global-ecosystems-atlas), GEO project-partners [Ai2](https://allenai.org/) have created the first version of an ecosystem category segmentation model that can be used to map terrestrial and near-land ecosystems in the Maldives. [This repository](https://github.com/allenai/maldives_ecosystem_mapping) contains the workflow and configuration files needed to reproduce the training of the ecosystem category segmentation model, and supports applying the model on new images.

   
# Frequently Asked Questions

Here are some commonly asked question and answers about the Atlas:

### Where do Global Ecosystems Atlas datasets come from?

The Global Ecosystems Atlas was created by compiling existing spatial data products developed to represent ecosystems. These maps come from high-quality national, regional, and global repositories. Each dataset has been subjected to a rigorous evaluation process, including validation and harmonization with the IUCN [Global Ecosystem Typology](https://global-ecosystems.org/explore) - an internationally recognized system for classifying ecosystems across terrestrial, freshwater and marine realms.

### What can you do with the Global Ecosystems Atlas?
Lots of things!! The Global Ecosystems Atlas has been designed as a versatile platform for identifying distribution of different ecosystem types, supporting conservation and restoration efforts, informing environmental management decisions, conducting research, and aiding in environmental and corporate reporting. The Atlas does this by bringing together high-quality global, regional and national ecosystem maps into a single, open, online resource. Presenting the extent, structure and function of the world’s ecosystems in unprecedented detail, the Atlas will enable everyone—from governments to individual citizens—to take action to protect nature.

Specific uses of the Atlas include:

#### Tracking progress on the Global Biodiversity Framework
The Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) includes targets to achieve the mission of halting and reversing biodiversity loss. Countries can use the Atlas to access measurements and derive insights that support stock-taking, monitoring and reporting on indicators of progress toward achieving the ecosystem-focused GBF goals and targets.

#### Developing national ecosystem maps where they don’t yet exist
For countries that don’t yet have a national ecosystem classification and map, the Atlas will offer guidelines, resources, examples, map standards to assist countries in developing new maps to use for policy, planning, decision-making and action related to ecosystems and biodiversity.

#### Contributing to Nature-based Solutions
Knowledge about ecosystem distributions will help support a better understanding of nature-based climate solutions and help improve our knowledge of the essential ecosystem services provided by ecosystems around the world.

#### Supporting natural capital accounting
The System of Environmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA) is an internationally agreed statistical framework that measures stocks and flows of natural resources, including ecosystems. The Atlas will provide up-to-date data to support generation of SEEA ecosystem accounts.

#### Informing financial disclosures
Under some laws and voluntary frameworks, companies and financial institutions are required to make financial disclosures that describe risks and opportunities related to the climate and nature. The Atlas will offer consistent data to support the effective operation of laws and frameworks.

#### Enhancing financial structuring and risk insurance
An increasing number of countries and communities invest in risk insurance to protect against climate- and nature-related loss and damage. New ecosystems knowledge can lead to new opportunities in financial structuring based on the underlying value of ecosystem services.
