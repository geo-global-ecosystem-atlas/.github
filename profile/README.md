# Overview

The Global Ecosystems Atlas is a versatile platform for identifying distribution of different ecosystem types, supporting conservation and restoration efforts, informing environmental management decisions, conducting research, and aiding in environmental and corporate reporting. The Atlas does this by bringing together high-quality global, regional and national ecosystem maps into a single, open, online resource. Presenting the extent, structure and function of the world’s ecosystems in unprecedented detail, the Atlas will enable everyone—from governments to individual citizens—to take action to protect nature.

# Frequently Asked Questions

Here are some commonly asked question and answers about the Atlas:

### Where do Global Ecosystems Atlas datasets come from?

The Global Ecosystems Atlas was created by compiling existing spatial data products developed to represent ecosystems. These maps come from high-quality national, regional, and global repositories. Each dataset has been subjected to a rigorous evaluation process, including validation and harmonization with the IUCN [Global Ecosystem Typology](https://global-ecosystems.org/explore) - an internationally recognized system for classifying ecosystems across terrestrial, freshwater and marine realms.

### What can you do with the Global Ecosystems Atlas?
Lots of things!!

#### Track progress on the Global Biodiversity Framework
The Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) includes targets to achieve the mission of halting and reversing biodiversity loss. Countries can use the Atlas to access measurements and derive insights that support stock-taking, monitoring and reporting on indicators of progress toward achieving the ecosystem-focused GBF goals and targets.

#### Develop national ecosystem maps where they don’t yet exist
For countries that don’t yet have a national ecosystem classification and map, the Atlas will offer guidelines, resources, examples, map standards to assist countries in developing new maps to use for policy, planning, decision-making and action related to ecosystems and biodiversity.

#### Contribute to Nature-based Solutions
Knowledge about ecosystem distributions will help support a better understanding of nature-based climate solutions and help improve our knowledge of the essential ecosystem services provided by ecosystems around the world.

#### Support natural capital accounting
The System of Environmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA) is an internationally agreed statistical framework that measures stocks and flows of natural resources, including ecosystems. The Atlas will provide up-to-date data to support generation of SEEA ecosystem accounts.

#### Inform financial disclosures
Under some laws and voluntary frameworks, companies and financial institutions are required to make financial disclosures that describe risks and opportunities related to the climate and nature. The Atlas will offer consistent data to support the effective operation of laws and frameworks.

#### Enhance financial structuring and risk insurance
An increasing number of countries and communities invest in risk insurance to protect against climate- and nature-related loss and damage. New ecosystems knowledge can lead to new opportunities in financial structuring based on the underlying value of ecosystem services.
